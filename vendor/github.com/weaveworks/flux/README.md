# Flux

We believe that environments should be entirely version
controlled. This is an anti-fragile measure to ensure stability
through visibility. If anything fails, you can simply reapply the
current state of the repository.

Flux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster
matches what is specified in version control (along with a few
[extra features](/site/how-it-works.md)).

It is most useful when used as a deployment tool at the end of a
Continuous Delivery pipeline. Flux will make sure that your new
container images and config changes are propagated to the cluster.
