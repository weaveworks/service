This service polls configured github projects for unassigned PRs,
and assigns them randomly according to its configured list.

You may specify directives in the PR description to control behaviour.
Directives are lines that begin "pr-assigner: ", followed by a directive name
then any number of comma-seperated args.
The following directives are currently defined:
	pr-assigner: ignore
		Args are ignored. The pr-assigner will not touch this PR.
	pr-assigner: exclude {USERS}
		Any named user will not be assigned.
		For example, if the configured assignee list was "alice", "bob", "charlie" and "david"
		and alice made a PR with "pr-assigner: exclude bob, david", then "charlie" would be assigned.
