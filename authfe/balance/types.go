	// Get is called when wanting to send a request to a Service. It returns the
	// Endpoint that request should be directed to. When used with an affinity load
	// balancing scheme, the affinity key needs to be given as argument to this
	// function.
	//
	// When used with an affinity load balancing scheme, Get will panic if no key
	// or more than one key is given. The variadic form is only used for
	// aesthetics, ie. being able to use Get() which non-affinity load balancers.
	//
	// Get may return nil when the load balancer is not aware of any
	// Endpoint.
	Get(key ...string) Endpoint
	// Put releases the Endpoint when it has finished processing the request.
