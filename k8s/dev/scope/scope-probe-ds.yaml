        # We cannot refer to the Scope App with its Kubernetes Service

        # allow customizing the DNS servers (the Kubernetes DNS add-on
        # server in this case) of a container when it runs in the
        # host's network namespace (see
        # https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/10384#issuecomment-72069550
        # ). Instead, we use variable expansion on its service
        # environment variables.
        #
        # NOTE: Unfortunately this imposes a specific creation
        # ordering since the Scope App Service needs to be created first for
        # the service environment variables below to be accesible.
