## Testing

In order to test the weekly summary emails on a local instance, both Flux and Prom services need to be running to generate the weekly report. To avoid that, the report generator can be pointed to remote services by changing `promURI`/`fluxURI` constants in `weekly-summary.go`. For example,
to point them to an instance in dev, the endpoints need to changed to:

```
const = (
    promURI = "https://user:[TOKEN]@frontend.dev.weave.works/api/prom"
    fluxURI = "https://user:[TOKEN]@frontend.dev.weave.works/api/flux"
)
```
